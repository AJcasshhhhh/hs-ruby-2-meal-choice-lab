# Meal Choice

Define breakfast, lunch and dinner methods that take in a meal_choice argument and declare the appropriate time to eat that meal. Include a default meal_choice for each method. Code your methods in the meal_choice.rb doc and call all of them (with and without arguments) at the bottom of the doc. Then run your program.
