# Meal Choice

Fork and clone this lab and do your work in the meal_choice.rb file. 

Your job is to define breakfast, lunch and dinner methods that take in a meal_choice argument and declare the appropriate time to eat that meal. Include a default meal_choice for each method. Take a look at the example code to get started. 

Call all of your methods (with and without arguments) at the bottom of the doc. Then run your program.
